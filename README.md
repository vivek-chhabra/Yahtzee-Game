## Rules of Yahtzee üìú

Yahtzee is a game played with five dice and a scorecard. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by achieving specific combinations.

<br>

### Gameplay üéÆ

1. On their turn, a player can roll the dice up to three times.
2. After each roll, the player can choose which dice to keep and which to reroll.
3. The player can reroll any or all of the dice.
4. Once the player decides to stop rolling or reaches the maximum of three rolls, they must choose a category on their scorecard to score their points.
5. The player must select a category that matches their dice combination. For example, if they rolled three 4s and two 1s, they could choose the "Fours" category or the "Ones" or the full house category to score points.
6. After choosing a category, the player scores points based on the specific rules for that category.
7. Once a category has been scored, it cannot be used again in subsequent turns.
8. Players take turns rolling the dice and scoring until all categories have been filled on their scorecards.
